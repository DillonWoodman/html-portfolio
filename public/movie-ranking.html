<h1>The Best Movies According to Dillon</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
<p>This movie taught me how to be delusional enough to shoot for the stars</p>
<h3>Persuit Of Happiness</h3>
<p>
  This is one of my favourite movies because it taught me the power of
  resilience
</p>
<h3>Big George Foreman</h3>
<p>
  This move is one of my favourite because despite rising to fame and losing
  everything it taught me you can regain everything again with renewed faith
